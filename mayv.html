					Foreword
				</p>
				<h1>
					I accepted this project on a whim.
				</h1>

				<p  class="pb_0" >
					I was approached by two MBA students and a chaotic Miro board full of hypothetical
					 user flows, user market analyses, and simple wireframes. Chaotic as it was, I could tell 
					 the amount of work they’d put in, and the potential they saw within this product. With all
					  of these ideas and no design expertise, they needed a designer, or rather a design team. 
					  I spearheaded the beginnings of their design team and eventually heading it as design lead.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our challenge was ambitious: design the interface and experience of the Mayv app within a 15-week semester. 
					<br><br>
					This project, was not only a design project that pushed my limits as a designer, 
					but also taught me the importance of leading a team. In addition to the challenges
					 of the design, I was equally challenged to reflect on how I could steer and empower 
					 the team forward (not to mention during a worldwide pandemic!). It wasn’t easy 
					 – there were lots of failures and lessons learned. But in the end, we pushed 
					 through, and I’m so thankful for this immense learning opportunity.

						<h1>Understanding what it’s like to live with chronic pain.</h1>
					</div>

					<div class="col-12 col-lg-112 pb_0" >
						<p>
							Our research sprint spanned 2 weeks, but trickled through. We wanted to use this time well 
							and selected methods that were could be feasibly executed while getting a diverse spread of information.
							<br>
							<br>
							Based on our research we derived three design goals that Ubiquity Repositories is based on.
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3 class="mt_1">Literature</h3>
					<p> We delved into 
						literature to understand how autoimmune patients cope with 
						their condition, and how integrative medicine techniques
						 are assimilated into a patient’s lifestyle. There was also
						  an handful of literature dedicated to the analysis of 
						  therapeutic apps. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>patients preferred easy tap user interfaces to multitap or slider methods, and vertical question layouts</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							
							<p>patients liked to be engaged by progress feedback reports and educational tips </p>
 
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>avoiding dark design patterns (addiction, social anxiety, purchase patterns)</p>
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>patients weigh clinical treatments (drugs, surgical procedures) and alternative medicine (physical therapy, massages, acupuncture, CBT, CBD) equally </p>
						</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h3 class="mt_1">Competitive Analyses</h3>
					<p> We also looked into the medical/healthcare apps to examine whether existing products could align with our focus.  </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>users want to track their growth over time and receive motivation from the application</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							
							<p>applications that create and form communities promote continued growth and loyalty</p>
 
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>users seek connections and bonds with other members, even through anonymity</p>
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>users want to receive specialized, catered feedback based on their inputs (symptoms, logs, surveys) </p>
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>users want to evolve with their disease and partake in new educational content</p>
						</li>
						
					</ul>


					<h3 class="mt_1">User Interviews</h3>
					<p> We conducted interviews with autoimmune patients from across the country.
						Through these conversations, we learned about their day-to-day habits, 
						and their personal experiences coping with chronic pain and flareups. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>source of information came from multiple sources, including articles, medical journals, social media, and TV shows</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							
							<p>patients without strong support groups from friends or family reached out to online communities and forums</p>
 
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>patients were fearful of pain and felt the need to control environments in case of flare-ups</p>
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>lots of uncertainty and anxiety regarding CBD (access, legality, effects)  </p>
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>patients are skeptical of mindfulness techniques, but are willing to give them a try</p>
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>- the disease changes your personality </p>
						</li>

							<p>After our research sprint, we were ready to apply our learnings to the project.
								 However, we quickly realized that our individual conceptions of our goal were

								  our design team and the client’s goals were tied together before we could 
								  make any design decisions.
								  <br>
								  <br>

								To achieve this clarity, we used a framing exercise
								to focus on the specific problem our app is trying to address. 
								With the team and client, we sat down and listed all of our conceptions of the
								 solutions, constraints, and ultimate impact of this app. 
								 Afterwards, we converged on a unified “How Might We” question and a 
								 centered design goal to work toward.

						<h3>Ideation</h3>
							

						<p>With all of our research findings, I invited our designers and our

						<h3>Converging with a problem map</h3>
							

						<p>To converge on this features we structured our ideation session around a problem map centered around the patient. To begin, we listed the most apparent problems that chronic pain patients faced, and used those to center our features. We also considered other factors such as feasbility, and the value/impact on patients.

							<br>
							 For example, although body pain map tracking seemed to be a great way for patients to track their condition, we felt the interactions and data produced might be too complex for patients to gain insight from.

						<div class="mt_1 overall-spacing">
						<h3>Lesson of the Day</h3>	
						<p class="mb_1">The lesson of the day element is the key entry points for patients going into their lesson.

							 a metric of progress for motivation. Initially, we experimented with different 
							 call-to-action styles, and different progress indicators. </p>

						<p class="mb_1">As we progressed, we grouped the Lesson and Reflection portion of the program into one call-to-action button,

							 Language of the lesson button was changed from “Watch” to “Begin” to adapt to both video and audio lessons. </p>

						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<h3>Education → My Program</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1">The education section experienced the most change. Initially,
								 it began as a page with two tabs, splitting education from meditations.
								  Meditations were separate from the education, but unlocked as the
								   patient’s progressed through the lessons. A constant critique was
								    that it was not clear where to find the meditations from the navigation bar.  </p>

							<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<p class="mb_1">Although we understood this complication, we also did not believe that 
								meditation was a large enough feature to have its own section on the navigation.
								 Instead, we decided to rename “Education” into “Your Program” to generalize 
								 the contents of this section. Furthermore, we got rid of the 2-tab system 
								 and split the two sections vertically. We were cognizant of reducing screen
								  real estate, and making sure that both the Lessons and Meditations were visible above the fold of the screen.   </p>

						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<h3>Tweaking the self tracking.</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1">One common problem we found with our tracking method was that it was 
								long and cumbersome, with no way to select the specific symptoms that a patient
								 wanted to record on that day. Rather, it would present all of the possible
								  symptoms in one endlessly scrolling survey.  </p>

							<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<p class="mb_1">To give more intention to the patient, we broke up the self tracking into a 
								ulti-page approach, beginning with a prompt to select  the symptoms they’d like to record. 
								Another given benefit of this change was that it introduced more friction into the experience, 
								giving patients more space to contemplate each symptom, rather than breezing through the form.    </p>
