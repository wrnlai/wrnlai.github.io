							<p>We were ready to apply our learnings but we quickly realized

								    founder's goals were unified. 
								  <br>
								  <br>

								To achieve this clarity, we used a HMW framing exercise to

							<h1>Initial Prototyping</h1>
							<p>Early sketches and prototyping focused on hierarchy
								and prioritizing user actions.  Without any prior screens, 
								we used this design sprint to nail down our highest priority
								elements and create basic wireframes that embodied our user flows. 

								Given the unique structure of this program and demographic,
								we strove to create a interface that could easily navigate
								through the program and motivate patients to complete the program at an encouraged pace.

							<h1>Crafting a design system</h1>
							<p>
								Our team worked to create a design system that
								 could suit mobile experiences, while staying 
								 in line with our brand guidelines. 
		
							</p>

							<div class="mt_1">
								<h3>Typography</h3>
								<p>The brand solely relied on one typeface and one weight, 
									Solanel Regular. The neo-grotesque font featured
									 flawless curves evoking calm tones. While we were
									  experimenting with the different sizes, it was
									   difficult to produce enough contrast to distinguish
										between different headers and body fonts. We decided
										 to introduce a bolder weight into the overall design,
										reserving use for headers and buttons. 
								</p>

							<div class="mt_1">
								<h3>Gridding</h3>
								<p>When designing the gridding, we wanted to create a system that had a 
									balanced whitespace:content ratio. Going back to our mindfulness principles,
									 it was important to restrain the amount of content being displayed in one screen.

							<h1>Design Iterations</h1>
							<p>
								For the later half of the semester, we honed our wireframes towards high fidelity. 
								Each week recieved a new set of iterations, based on client and team critique. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="mt_1 overall-spacing">
							<h3>Lesson of the Day</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1">The “Lesson of the Day” element is the main entry point for patients 
								going into their lesson. It aims to set a healthy expectation of what a patient 
								should finish in a day and provide a metric of progress.
								 Initially, we experimented with different call-to-action 
								 styles and different progress indicators.</p>
						</div>
						<img class="img-fluid my_0" id="desired-features" src="assets/img/mayv/design iterations/lesson plan.png"> 

						<div class="mt_1 overall-spacing">
							<p class="mb_1">
								As we progressed, we grouped the “Lesson” and “Reflection” portion 
								of the program into one call-to-action button and showcased a 
								variety of meditation cards. Language of the “Lesson” button 
								was changed from “Watch” to “Begin” to adapt for both video 
								and audio lessons.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<h3>Education → My Program</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1"> 
								The “Education” section experienced 
								the most change. Initially, it began
								 as a page with two tabs, splitting
								  “Education” from “Meditations”.
								   Meditations were separate from
									the education, but unlocked as
									 the patient’s progressed through
									  the lessons. A constant critique
									   was that it was not clear where
										to find the meditations from
										 the navigation bar.

							</p>
						</div>
						<img class="img-fluid my_0" id="desired-features" src="assets/img/mayv/design iterations/Education to My Program.png"> 
	
						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<p class="mb_1">
								Although we understood this complication, we also did not believe
								 that “Meditations” was a large enough feature to have its
								  own section on the nav bar. Instead, we decided to rename
								   “Education” into “Your Program” to generalize the contents
									of this section. Furthermore, we got rid of the 2-tab
									 system and split the two sections vertically. We were
									  cognizant of reducing screen real estate, and making
									   sure that both the Lessons and Meditations were visible
									    above the fold of the screen.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<h3>Tweaking the self tracking</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1">
								Our tracking method was cumbersome,
								 with no way to specify symptoms that a
								  patient wanted to record on that day. 
								  Rather, it presented all of the possible 
								  symptoms in one endlessly scrolling survey.


							</p>
						</div>
						<img class="img-fluid my_0" id="desired-features" src="assets/img/mayv/design iterations/tweaking self tracking.png"> 

						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
						<p class="mb_1">
							To add more intention to this design, we broke up the self tracking
							 into a multi-page approach, beginning with a prompt to select the
							 symptoms they’d like to record. Another given benefit of this
							  change was that it introduced more friction into the experience,
							   giving patients more space to contemplate each symptom,
								rather than breezing through the form. Furthermore,
								 we displayed short descriptions for each of the
								  descriptors on the likert scales.

							<h1>Looking back at our progress</h1>
							<p>

								This was my first time designing in
								 the role of a design lead. In 
								 addition to building my skills in UI/UX
								  design, this project challenged me
								   to think deeply about fostering an
									environment for a design team and
									 my role overseeing the design of
									  the product. It wasn’t easy – 
									  there were many lessons learned.
									   But in the end, we pushed through,
										and I’m thankful for this immense 
										learning opportunity.  

							</p>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Ensuring design consistency</h3>
								<p>
									Consistency in design extends past the visual style guide.
									 Does each interface transition seamlessly across different
									  features? If components are being utilized, is the
									   interaction also consistent? These questions are
										especially important to consider when designers
										 are working separately on different features.
										  At times, it may seem logical for one to design
										   interfaces to best house a specific function.
											However, it’s important to consider how this
											 design sits within the overall experience,
											  and the friction that comes from introducing
											   different contexts.
								</p>

							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Embracing Uncertainty</h3>
								<p>
									Despite having run through the human-centered design proces
									s a couple of times now, I realize that the process is much messier, 
									especially in a start-up environment.
									 This uncertainty taught us the importance of
									  placing intentionality in the methods that we used
									and to constantly reflect on the effectiveness of our methods. 
								</p>

							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Client Communication</h3>
								<p>
									As I began to learn the product inside and out, I found myself bringing forward meaningful
									 conversations that challenged the clients to think about the experience differently. 
									 In many cases, the key point is being able to show how your design decisions translate
									  into the bigger picture of the product. 
								</p>

							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Team Communication</h3>
								<p>
									I have learned that great designers are not only good at design itself; 
									they’re also people who can influence others, who can help others on the 
									team achieve their goals. Throughout this project, I practiced to
									 provide criticism constructively and clearly. 
									 As this project comes to a close, communication is one of the skills that I will continually work on improving.

							<h1>As expected, there were a fair number of learning opportunities too</h1>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Timing</h3>
								<p>
									Our biggest challenge came down to the timing when scoping
									 out this project. With only 15 weeks, I’d thought 
									 we’d be able to run an end-to-end design project, but 
									 at the end, we barely finished prototyping. User testing
									  was pushed to be done in the summer after the semester ended.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Tracing back our steps</h3>
								<p>
									In our process, I overlooked some design decisions that came back and haunted us later on down the road.
									Some examples: 
								</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
												Typography and style guide was not clearly set before going into hi-fi.
											</p>
										</li>

										<li>
											<p>
							
												Health tracking/ symptom logging’s user flow was not developed enough to be prototyped. 
												We realized there were a plethora of complex use cases that had not been addressed, but were too constrained on time / too far in build it through.		
											
											</p>
										</li>


									</ul>



								<p>
									Some of the issues we encountered can be traced
									 back to our short window of 15 weeks to complete the project. If I could time travel and redo this project with the knowledge I have today, I would build in more milestones during the early prototyping stage that would allow the team to assess progress and solidify our design direction.
