							Our research sprint spanned 2 weeks, but trickled through the rest of the semester.
							To ensure time was used efficiently, we selected methods that could be feasibly executed while getting a diverse spread of information.
						
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3 class="mt_1">Literature</h3>
					<p> 
						We delved into literature to understand how 
						autoimmune patients cope with their condition
						 and how alternative medicine techniques are 
						 assimilated into a patient’s lifestyle. 
						 There was also a handful of literature 
						 dedicated to the analysis of therapeutic apps.
					</p>

					
					<ul class="my_0">
						
						<li>
							<p>Patients preferred easy tap user interfaces to multitap or slider methods, and vertical question layouts.</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							
							<p>Patients liked to be engaged by progress feedback reports and educational tips.</p>
 
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>Avoid dark design patterns (addiction, social anxiety, purchase patterns).</p>
						</li>
						<li>

							<p>Designing for mindfulness: “Promote a calm experience by providing a sense of completion and giving users an option to disengage”.</p>
						</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h3 class="mt_1">Competitive Analyses</h3>
					<p> We also looked into the medical/healthcare apps and reviews to examine whether existing products could align with our focus.
					</p>
					<ul class="my_0">
						<li>
							<p>Patients want to track their growth over time and receive motivation from the application.</p>

						</li>
						<!-- <li>
							
							<p>Virtual pain coaches were widely popular, but had limitations (+ a little creepy). </p>
 
						</li> -->
						<li>
							
							<p>Many apps had significant experiences dedicated to educating patients on their condition through mini lessons, articles, and surveys. </p>
 
						</li>
						<!-- <li>

							<p>Patients seek connections and bonds with other members, even through anonymity.</p>

						<!-- <li>

							<p>Patients want to evolve with their disease and partake in new educational content.</p>
						</li> -->
						
					</ul>


					<h3 class="mt_1">User Interviews</h3>
					<p> We conducted interviews with autoimmune patients from across the country.
						 Through these conversations, we learned about their day-to-day habits, 
						 and their personal experiences coping with chronic pain and flare-ups.</p>
					<ul class="my_0">
						<li>
							<p>Source of information came from multiple sources, including articles, medical journals, social media, and TV shows.</p>

						</li>
						<!-- <li>
							
							<p>patients without strong support groups from friends or family reached out to online communities and forums</p>

							<p>After our research sprint, we were ready to apply our learnings to the project.

								  make any design decisions.
								  <br>
								  <br>

								To achieve this clarity, we used a framing exercise
								to focus on the specific problem our app is trying to address. 
								With the team and client, we sat down and listed all of our conceptions of the
								 solutions, constraints, and ultimate impact of this app. 
								 Afterwards, we converged on a unified “How Might We” question and a 
								 centered design goal to work toward.

							  and used those as platforms to anchor our features. We also considered other 
							  factors such as feasibility, and the value/impact on patients.

							<br>

								<p>When designing the gridding, we wanted to create a system that had a 
									balanced whitespace:content ratio. Going back to our mindfulness principles,
									 it was important to restrain the amount of content being displayed in one screen.

							<h1>Design Iterations</h1>
							<p>
								For the later half of the semester, we honed our wireframes towards high fidelity. 
								Each week recieved a new set of iterations, based on client and team critique. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="mt_1 overall-spacing">
							<h3>Lesson of the Day</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1">The “Lesson of the Day” element is the main entry point for patients 
								going into their lesson. It aims to set a healthy expectation of what a patient 
								should finish in a day and provide a metric of progress.
								 Initially, we experimented with different call-to-action 
								 styles and different progress indicators.</p>
						</div>
						<img class="img-fluid my_0" id="desired-features" src="assets/img/mayv/design iterations/lesson plan.png"> 

						<div class="mt_1 overall-spacing">
							<p class="mb_1">
								As we progressed, we grouped the “Lesson” and “Reflection” portion 
								of the program into one call-to-action button and showcased a 
								variety of meditation cards. Language of the “Lesson” button 
								was changed from “Watch” to “Begin” to adapt for both video 
								and audio lessons.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<h3>Education → My Program</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1"> 
								The “Education” section experienced 
								the most change. Initially, it began
								 as a page with two tabs, splitting
								  “Education” from “Meditations”.
								   Meditations were separate from
									the education, but unlocked as
									 the patient’s progressed through
									  the lessons. A constant critique
									   was that it was not clear where
										to find the meditations from
										 the navigation bar.

							</p>
						</div>
						<img class="img-fluid my_0" id="desired-features" src="assets/img/mayv/design iterations/Education to My Program.png"> 
	
						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<p class="mb_1">
								Although we understood this complication, we also did not believe
								 that “Meditations” was a large enough feature to have its
								  own section on the nav bar. Instead, we decided to rename
								   “Education” into “Your Program” to generalize the contents
									of this section. Furthermore, we got rid of the 2-tab
									 system and split the two sections vertically. We were
									  cognizant of reducing screen real estate, and making
									   sure that both the Lessons and Meditations were visible
									    above the fold of the screen.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
							<h3>Tweaking the self tracking</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1">
								Our tracking method was cumbersome,
								 with no way to specify symptoms that a
								  patient wanted to record on that day. 
								  Rather, it presented all of the possible 
								  symptoms in one endlessly scrolling survey.


							</p>
						</div>
						<img class="img-fluid my_0" id="desired-features" src="assets/img/mayv/design iterations/tweaking self tracking.png"> 

						<div class="my_1 overall-spacing">
						<p class="mb_1">
							To add more intention to this design, we broke up the self tracking
							 into a multi-page approach, beginning with a prompt to select the
							 symptoms they’d like to record. Another given benefit of this
							  change was that it introduced more friction into the experience,
							   giving patients more space to contemplate each symptom,
								rather than breezing through the form. Furthermore,
								 we displayed short descriptions for each of the
								  descriptors on the likert scales.

							<h1>Looking back at our progress</h1>
							<p>

								This was my first time designing in
								 the role of a design lead. In 
								 addition to building my skills in UI/UX
								  design, this project challenged me
								   to think deeply about fostering an
									environment for a design team and
									 my role overseeing the design of
									  the product. It wasn’t easy – 
									  there were many lessons learned.
									   But in the end, we pushed through,
										and I’m thankful for this immense 
										learning opportunity.  

							</p>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Ensuring design consistency</h3>
								<p>
									Consistency in design extends past the visual style guide.
									 Does each interface transition seamlessly across different
									  features? If components are being utilized, is the
									   interaction also consistent? These questions are
										especially important to consider when designers
										 are working separately on different features.
										  At times, it may seem logical for one to design
										   interfaces to best house a specific function.
											However, it’s important to consider how this
											 design sits within the overall experience,
											  and the friction that comes from introducing
											   different contexts.
								</p>

							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Embracing Uncertainty</h3>
								<p>
									Despite having run through the human-centered design proces
									s a couple of times now, I realize that the process is much messier, 
									especially in a start-up environment.
									 This uncertainty taught us the importance of
									  placing intentionality in the methods that we used
									and to constantly reflect on the effectiveness of our methods. 
								</p>

							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Client Communication</h3>
								<p>
									As I began to learn the product inside and out, I found myself bringing forward meaningful
									 conversations that challenged the clients to think about the experience differently. 
									 In many cases, the key point is being able to show how your design decisions translate
									  into the bigger picture of the product. 
								</p>

							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Team Communication</h3>
								<p>
									I have learned that great designers are not only good at design itself; 
									they’re also people who can influence others, who can help others on the 
									team achieve their goals. Throughout this project, I practiced to
									 provide criticism constructively and clearly. 
									 As this project comes to a close, communication is one of the skills that I will continually work on improving.

							<h1>As expected, there were a fair number of learning opportunities too</h1>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Timing</h3>
								<p>
									Our biggest challenge came down to the timing when scoping
									 out this project. With only 15 weeks, I’d thought 
									 we’d be able to run an end-to-end design project, but 
									 at the end, we barely finished prototyping. User testing
									  was pushed to be done in the summer after the semester ended.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Tracing back our steps</h3>
								<p>
									In our process, I overlooked some design decisions that came back and haunted us later on down the road.
									Some examples: 
								</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>
												Typography and style guide was not clearly set before going into hi-fi.
											</p>
										</li>

										<li>
											<p>
							
												Health tracking/ symptom logging’s user flow was not developed enough to be prototyped. 
												We realized there were a plethora of complex use cases that had not been addressed, but were too constrained on time / too far in build it through.		
											
											</p>
										</li>


									</ul>



									
									<br>
									<br>
								<p>
									Some of the issues we encountered can be traced
									 back to our short window of 15 weeks to complete the project. If I could time travel and redo this project with the knowledge I have today, I would build in more milestones during the early prototyping stage that would allow the team to assess progress and solidify our design direction.
