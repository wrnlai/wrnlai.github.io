							<p class="body">Though the challenge given seemed relatively straightforward,
								 we soon realized that this project could become very open-ended.
								  Each of my teammates had their own perspective on their voter
								   experience; what needed to be fixed and enhanced was different
									between all of us, based on our own voting experiences. We
									 decided to first conduct a “Facts, Assumptions, and Questions” ( FAQ)  to explore each perspective and find any areas of overlap.  

								After the FAQ, we also realized that we had more questions than answers
								 at the moment, particularly concerning the reasons why politics and
								  traditional social networks could not mesh. We then decided to conduct
								   some secondary research on this matter, highlighting the populations 
								   response to social network politics. </p>

									Voters who have not educated themselves on their candidates felt that their vote didn’t matter. </p>

								<li><p class="body">Voters desired a central source of objective political information, as opposed 
									to having the back-and-forth between different news sources. </p>
								</li>
								<li><p class="body">Unsurprisingly, voters were very timid about voicing their political stances, 
									only because they did not want to misjudged or be viewed within the frame of their vote. 
									Yet, voters had no problem voicing the fact that they were politically active (‘I Voted!’) </p>

						 Many of our shared a similar educational theme, and looked for different ways
						  for the ballot to connect to objective and educational information on the candidate.
						   Other screens centralized on creating a journey while voting and educating oneself on the candidate.

						  After looking at our screens, we compartmentalized the voting process into 4 sections.
