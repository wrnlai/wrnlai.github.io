								<p class=body>
										In academia, it is common practice for the Institution 
										to showcase their research to the general public to promote
										the quality work of their researchers. This allows academics to
										publish their content without having to deal with the hassle of 
										publishing through a major publication. In addition, it serves to
										build the institution’s research influence in the broader academic
											community. 

									</p>
							


								<p class=body>
										Anything from masters theses, archived art, datasets, 
										to journal publications can be found in a centralized
										database we call a repository.
									</p>

								<p class="header-4">What was our role?</p>	

										<p class="body">Ubiquity Press recently partnered with several research 
												institutions in American and London to host their open access
												 repositories. </p>

										<p class="body">
												Together with Mattin Delavar, we were given the task 
												to create a repository framework that would be highly 
												customizable for any research institution to use. Although 
												there was a MVP prototype in testing, we were tasked to
												 approach with fresh eyes to create a new design that 
												 emphasized usability and reduced friction.

					<p class="header-4">How we designed our user flow
						 </p>

					<p class="body"> From our research, we found that most people conceptualized the r
						epository into two functionalities: Search and Browse. While Search was for those
						 with either very specific queries, it was meant for users who wanted to broaden
						  their search from a single point.
						  <br>

						Vice versa, the browse functionality were for users to get a 
						glance from a broad level, and then converge onto a single category
						 of search (i.e “Masters Theses from the Computer Science Department”). 
						 We decided to change the name of this functionlaity to Explore, as we felt
						  that it captured the experience much more accurately.
						  <br> 
							
							We began designing our userflow from the homepage, as most
							 pages revolved around this and then split the main functionality
							  into its two core functionalities
