							Our research sprint spanned 2 weeks, but trickled through the rest of the semester.

							 executed while getting a diverse spread of information.
							<br>
							<br>
						
						</p>
					</div>

					<h3 class="mt_1">Literature</h3>
					<p> We delved into literature to understand how autoimmune patients
						 cope with their condition, and how integrative medicine techniques
						  are assimilated into a patient’s lifestyle. There was also 
						  a handful of literature dedicated to the analysis of therapeutic apps. </p>

					
					<ul class="my_0">
						
						<li>
							<p>patients preferred easy tap user interfaces to multitap or slider methods, and vertical question layouts</p>

						</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h3 class="mt_1">Competitive Analyses</h3>
					<p> We also looked into the medical/healthcare apps and reviews to examine whether existing products could align with our focus.
					</p>
					<ul class="my_0">
						<li>
							<p>Users want to track their growth over time and receive motivation from the application</p>

						</li>
						<li>
							
							<p>Virtual pain coaches were widely popular, but had limitations (+ a little creepy). </p>
 
						</li>
						<li>
							
							<p>Many apps had significant experiences dedicated to educating patients on their condition through mini lessons, articles, and surveys. </p>
 
						</li>
						<li>

						</li>
						
					</ul>


					<h3 class="mt_1">User Interviews</h3>

						<li>
							<p>source of information came from multiple sources, including articles, medical journals, social media, and TV shows</p>

								To achieve this clarity, we used a framing exercise
								to focus on the specific problem our app is trying to address. 
								With the team and client, we sat down and listed all of our conceptions of the

							<p class="mb_1">As we progressed, we grouped the Lesson and Reflection portion of the program into one call-to-action button,

							<h3>Education → My Program</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1"> Initially, the education
								 began as a page with two tabs, splitting education from meditations.
								  A constant critique was
									that it was not clear where to find the meditations from the navigation bar.
								The use of tabs was also widely inconsistent among the other features in the app.

							meditations was a large-enough feature to have its own section on the navigation.
								Instead, we decided to rename “Education” into “Your Program” to generalize 
								the contents of this section. Furthermore, we got rid of the 2-tab system 
								and split the two sections vertically. We were cognizant of reducing screen
								real estate, and making sure that both the Lessons and Meditations were visible above the fold of the screen.

							<h3>Tweaking the self tracking.</h3>	
							<p class="mb_1">One common problem we found with our tracking method was that it was 
								long and cumbersome, with no way to select the specific symptoms that a patient
								 wanted to record on that day. Rather, it would present all of the possible
								  symptoms in one endlessly scrolling survey.  </p>

						<p class="mb_1">To give more intention to the patient, we broke up the self tracking into a 
							ulti-page approach, beginning with a prompt to select  the symptoms they’d like to record. 
							Another given benefit of this change was that it introduced more friction into the experience, 
							giving patients more space to contemplate each symptom, rather than breezing through the form.    </p>

							<h1>Looking back at our progress.</h1>
							<p>

								This was my first time designing a
								 new product as a design lead. 
								 In addition to building my skills
								  in UI/UX design, it also challenged me
								   to think deeply about team dynamics
									and the importance of team communication and critique.
									 It wasn’t easy – there were lots of failures and lessons learned.
									  But in the end, we pushed through, and I’m thankful for this immense learning opportunity.  

							</p>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Embracing Uncertainty</h3>
								<p>
									Despite having run through the human-centered design process a 
									couple of times now, I realize that the process is much messier, 
									especially regarding design in a start-up environment. 
									This uncertainty taught us the importance of placing 
									intentionality in the methods that we used, and to 
									constantly reflect on the effectiveness of our processes. 
								</p>

							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Client Communication</h3>
								<p>
									As I began to learn the product inside and out, I found myself bringing forward meaningful
									 conversations that challenged the clients to think about the experience differently. 
									 In many cases, the key point is being able to show how your design decisions translate
									  into the bigger picture of the product. 
								</p>

							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Team Communication</h3>
								<p>
									I have learned that great designers are not only good at design itself; 
									they’re also people who can influence others, who can help others on the 
									team achieve their goals. Throughout this project, I practiced to
									 provide criticism constructively and clearly. 
									 As this project comes to a close, communication is one of the skills that I will continually work on improving. 
								</p>

							</div>
						</div>

					<div class="section">
						<div class="overall-spacing">
							<h1>As expected, there were a fair number of failures too...</h1>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Timing</h3>
								<p>
									Much of it came down to timing when scoping out this project.
									 With only 15 weeks, I’d thought we’d be able to run an end to
									  end design project. We barely finished prototyping. 
									  User testing was pushed to be done in the Summer after the semester ended.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="my_1">
								<h3>Tracing back our steps</h3>
								<p>
									In our process, I overlooked some design decisions, which came back to bite us in the ass. 
									(e.g typography and style guide was not clearly set before going into hi-fi) 
									(e.g health tracking/ symptom logging’s user flow was not developed enough to be prototyped. 
									We realized there were a plethora of complex use cases that had not been addressed, but were too constrained on time / too far in build it through.)
									
									<br>
									<br>

									Some of of these failures can be traced to time constraints, no doubt. However, if I had to do it again, I’d allocate some meetings to reflecting on our progress so far, and analyzing areas that were glossed over and adapting our process together.
