							To design an onboarding experience, we first needed to understand how SkyAlert users 
							percieved the app, and learn about their understanding of natural distaster data.  
							 </p>

						<p class="body">
					
								Through SkyAlert’s twitter, we surveyed over 5000 users of the app to learn about their 
								experience using the app, and their user flows. Our contextual inquiries were done with 
								primarily Spanish-speaking college students, allowing us to observe how a user navigated 
								the onboarding process. Because all of our participants in the contextual inquiry had 
								never used SkyAlert before, we focused this portion of our research in understanding 
								how new users figured out the app but also gleamed some information specifically on their 
								response to onboarding.</p>

						</p>
						<p class="body">To initialize the app, we wanted to convey the benefits of the app right when users initially
							opened the app. This would allow us to introduce SkyAlert’s distinguishing benefits from their 
							competitors.
							From there, we began making mockups of an interactive onboarding processes 
							where users could interact with the app while the onboarding occurred. 
							We chose to focus primarily on educating the user about the data that 
							was being presented to them, particularly differentiating two types of 
							data that were often confused together: magnitude and intensity.

						</p> 
						<br>
					<p class="body">
							As we progressed further into our onboarding ideation, we realized that some 
							features on the app showed very obvious design flaws, which we attributed to
							some of the problems that our client initially expressed. Thus, we took it
							upon ourselves to redesign the purchase plans page. With these pages, we 
							wished to reestablish design consistency with the rest of the app and make
							it easier for users to compare and contrast certain purchase plans.

					Reflection
				</p>
				<p class="body">
						After reflecting on our final deliverable, we considered 
						potential future directions for this project and thought 
						about aspects of our project that could be improved if we had more time.
					
				</p>
				<ul >
						<li class="body">Because the feed and notifications page were convoluted
							 in their functions, it was easy to see how users could get confused by 
							 the two, or dismiss one for the other. If I had more time, I would redesign 
							 both the feed and notifications page to merge certain functions, and clearly
							  distinguish the two functionalities. </li>
						<li class="body">SkyAlert's app attempted the ambitious goal of creating an overly
							 comprehensive natural disaster app. There are tsunami alerts, volcano live feeds,
							  local weather alerts, and even insurance plans (in case your house is hit by disaster).
							   I would be interested in creating a way to clearly partition these functionalities
								into separate parts of the app, instead of, for example, jamming all the disaster 
								news into one 'feed'. 
							</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body"> 
						As this was the first mobile design project I have ever worked on, 
						I learned a ton about design principles and the HCD process. I really 
						saw the value of building insights from the users, which helped my team 
						and I drill down to the core problems we chose to tackle in our onboarding. 
						In the future, I want to learn more about visual design principles and continue
						practicing the HCD process.
