						<h3>SkyAlert is a startup currently based in Mexico and Berkeley, that provides 
							comprehensive natural disaster alerts through their app, as well as early 
							earthquake alerts.  In the Spring '18 semester through Berkeley Innovation, 
							I worked with David Olivar, Bhushan Balagar, and Monica Tang with SkyAlert
							 to develop an onboarding process for their app. Our team was mentored by 
							 Angela Huang.</h3>

								Through SkyAlert’s twitter, we surveyed over 5000 users of the app to learn about their

								primarily Spanish-speaking college students, allowing us to observe how a user navigated 
								the onboarding process. Because all of our participants in the contextual inquiry had 
								never used SkyAlert before, we focused this portion of our research in understanding 
								how new users figured out the app but also gleamed some information specifically on their 
								response to onboarding.</p>

						<h4 style="line-height: 150%">To initialize the app, we wanted to convey the benefits of the app right when users initially
							opened the app. This would allow us to introduce SkyAlert’s distinguishing benefits from their 
							competitors.
							From there, we began making mockups of an interactive onboarding processes 
							where users could interact with the app while the onboarding occurred. 
							We chose to focus primarily on educating the user about the data that 
							was being presented to them, particularly differentiating two types of 
							data that were often confused together: magnitude and intensity.

					</h4> 
					<h4 style="line-height: 150%">
							As we progressed further into our onboarding ideation, we realized that some 
							features on the app showed very obvious design flaws, which we attributed to
							some of the problems that our client initially expressed. Thus, we took it
							upon ourselves to redesign the purchase plans page. With these pages, we 
							wished to reestablish design consistency with the rest of the app and make
							it easier for users to compare and contrast certain purchase plans.
